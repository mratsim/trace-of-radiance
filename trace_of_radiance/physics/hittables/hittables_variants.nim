# Runtime dispatch
# ----------------------------------------------

# Note: We want to have a parallel RayTracer
#       we should use plain objects as much as possible
#       instead of involving the GC with
#       ref types and inheriance.
#       Instead we use concepts so that `hit` is statically dispatched
#       and object variants (ADT / Abstract Data Types)
#       for runtime dispatch on stack objects.
#
# This has the following benefits:
# - No GC-memory
# - No heap allocation
# - Easy to send across threads via trivial copy
# - pointer dereference is very often a cache miss
#   a branch misprediction is much less costly
#
# We also don't use shared pointer / refcounting
# (which is builtin to Nim GC).
# - Same reason: no heap memory wanted
# - Copying is better than sharing for multithreading
# - The type that we use are write-once at initialization
#   and their state don't evolve other time
# - Memory management of stack object is also automatic and much easier to reason about
#   than reference counting.
# - No bookkeeping
#
# A set of macros allow us to emulate classes
# with ADTs in a convenient way
